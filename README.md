# About
My GameJam project to given theme - **Stuck in a Loop**.

# Story
You are wizard, that likes experiments. 
One of your experiments but got out of your hand and imprisoned your in time loop.
If you want to safe your life you should try to leave your (wizards) residence.
It is not so easy as it sounds! 
You must overcome time loops and (your) security precautions against other envious and worse wizards.
Fortunatelly you have our magical wand (usefull for casting spells) and magical watches, that delays looping effect (if there is enough sand in it).
Collect items search safezones and try to survive (you have by the way limited amount of hitpoints)!
