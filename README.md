You are wizard, that likes experiments. 
One of your experiments but got out of your hand and imprisoned your in time loop.
If you want to safe your life you should try to leave your (wizards) residence.
It is not so easy as it sounds!

Fortunatelly you have our magical wand (usefull for casting spells) and magical watches, that delays looping effect (if there is enough sand in it).
